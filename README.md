Eclipse Code Metric Plugin

- Cyclomatic complexity. Measure cyclomatic complexity of single code blocks and identify methods that could be refactored for simplicity and readability.
- Code duplication. Identify similar blocks of code that could be generalized.
- Lines of codes and their growth over time. Perform an analysis on growth of code lines over time, which could show progress of project. Such information could be extracted from source code version control system.
- Analyze package/module/variable naming against proposed scheme. Check if de- velopers are following required naming schemes possibly identifying ”smelly” code.
- Unit dependencies. Measure single unit’s dependency count on other units. Identify units with too many dependencies, which could be refactored.
